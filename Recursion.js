//Bottom-Up - How you can build solution for one case off of the previous case
//Top-Down- How you can divide the problem for case N into sub problem
//Half and Half (Binary Search, Merge Sort) - Divide data in 2 sets
//Dynamic Programming - Find recursive algorithm, find over lapping sub problems, cache those results for future recursive calls.
